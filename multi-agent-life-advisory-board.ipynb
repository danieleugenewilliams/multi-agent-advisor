It leverages a team of AI advisors (Financial, Career, Health, Personal) to provide holistic guidance.\n\n## Problem\nPeople often face complex decisions requiring diverse perspectives (e.g., health, finance, personal fulfillment), but single-source advice lacks breadth. Existing systems may not tailor responses to user thinking styles (analytical, practical, relational, experimental) or evaluate response quality systematically.\n\n## Solution\nThe Life Advisory Board uses a multi-agent architecture with domain-specific knowledge bases (from PDFs). Advisors discuss queries collaboratively, tailoring advice to the user’s inferred style. A supervisor aggregates inputs into a unified response. Quality is assessed post-session using Google’s Text Quality rubric (coherence, fluency, instruction following, groundedness, verbosity), scoring 1-5, with non-participating advisors marked \"N/A.\"\n\n## How to Use\n1. **Setup**: Run in Kaggle with the `advisor-notes` dataset (Financial_Advice.pdf, Career_Advice.pdf, Health_Advice.pdf, Personal_Advice.pdf) added via \"Add Input.\"\n2. **Interact**: Execute the notebook, enter queries (e.g., \"Should I start a business?\"), and receive advice with background discussion.\n3. **Exit & Evaluate**: Type \"exit\" to end the chat and view quality evaluations for all responses.\n4. **Interpret**: Advice is ~150 words, discussion ~100 words per turn. Evaluations at end detail scores (5-1) for coherence, fluency, etc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup and Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install

The suggestions flow naturally.\n\n* **Fluency:** The language is smooth, grammatically correct, and uses appropriate vocabulary. The tone is encouraging and supportive.\n\n* **Instruction Following:** The response directly addresses the user's desire to build energy and strength. It provides concrete, relevant advice.\n\n* **Groundedness:** The response uses numbered references (\"Corpus #...\") suggesting it draws upon external sources of information. While we don't see the content of these corpora, the advice given aligns with common health recommendations.  The groundedness depends on the validity of the referenced corpora, which is unknown here.\n\n* **Verbosity:** The response is concise and provides sufficient detail without being overly wordy.  It offers a good balance of information and actionable steps.\n\n\n**Step 2: Score and Rationale**\n\nConsidering the above assessment, I would give the response a score of **4 (Good, minor flaws)**.\n\n* **Rationale:** The response is excellent in most aspects: coherent, fluent, follows instructions well, and is appropriately verbose.  The only minor flaw lies in the \"groundedness.\" While the reference to external corpora suggests a basis for the advice, we cannot verify the accuracy or reliability of those sources without access to them.  This uncertainty slightly lowers the score.  If the corpora were known to be reputable sources of health information, the score would be a 5.\nEvaluating prompt: \n    You are an expert evaluator assessing Text Quality (clarity, accuracy, engagement) based on:\n  ...\nPersonal Advisor: **Step 1: Criterion Assessment**\n\n* **Coherence:** The response is well-organized, presenting a logical sequence of steps for building energy and strength.

It provides a concrete plan with actionable steps.\n\n* **Groundedness:** While referencing \"Personal Advice Corpus #2,\" \"Health Advisor's advice,\" \"Corpus #12,\" and \"Corpus #17,\"  the response doesn't actually *use* information from these sources.  The advice given is generic and doesn't demonstrate reliance on these unspecified corpora. This is a weakness.\n\n* **Verbosity:** The response is concise and provides sufficient detail without being overly wordy.  The length is appropriate for the prompt.\n\n\n**Step 2: Score and Rationale**\n\nBased on the assessment above, I assign the response a score of **4 (Good, minor flaws)**.\n\nThe response excels in coherence, fluency, and instruction following.  It offers practical and helpful advice for improving energy and strength. However, the claim of grounding the advice in unspecified corpora (\"Corpus #2,\" etc.) is unsubstantiated and weakens the response.  While the advice itself is sound, the lack of actual grounding in the referenced sources prevents it from achieving a perfect score.  The response would be stronger with either removal of the corpus references or actual integration of information from those sources.\nEvaluating prompt: \n    You are an expert evaluator assessing Text Quality (clarity, accuracy, engagement) based on:\n  ...\nSupervisor: **Step 1: Criterion Assessment**\n\n* **Coherence:** The response is logically organized, progressing from general advice to specific recommendations.  The suggestions (walking, sleep, strength training, diet) are presented in a clear sequence and build upon each other.\n\n* **Fluency:** The response is grammatically correct, uses appropriate vocabulary, and flows smoothly. The tone is encouraging and supportive.\n\n* **Instruction Following:** The response directly addresses the user's desire to build energy and strength. It provides actionable advice.\n\n* **Groundedness:** The response doesn't rely on external information not provided in the prompt.  The suggestions are common sense health recommendations.\n\n* **Verbosity:** The response is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon.  It provides sufficient detail without being overly wordy.\n\n\n**Step 2: Score and Rationale**\n\nBased on the assessment above, I assign the response a score of **5 (very good)**.  The rationale is as follows:\n\n* **Coherence (5):** The advice is presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.  The structure is clear and effective.\n* **Fluency (5):** The writing is grammatically flawless, uses appropriate language, and maintains a consistent and encouraging tone.\n* **Instruction Following (5):** The response directly and comprehensively addresses the user's request for ways to increase energy and strength.\n* **Groundedness (5):** All suggestions are practical and based on general health knowledge, requiring no external information.\n* **Verbosity (5):** The response is neither too brief nor too lengthy. It provides sufficient detail without being overwhelming.  The length is perfectly suited to the prompt.\n\nThe response is exceptional in all aspects, providing helpful and well-structured advice.  It successfully addresses the user's needs in a clear, concise, and encouraging way.\n\nPrompt: thanks.\nFinancial Advisor: N/A - Did not participate in this session\nCareer Advisor: N/A - Did not participate in this session\nHealth Advisor: N/A - Did not participate in this session\nEvaluating prompt: \n    You are an expert evaluator assessing Text Quality (clarity, accuracy, engagement) based on:\n  ...\nPersonal Advisor: **Step 1: Criterion Assessment**\n\n* **Coherence:** The response is somewhat coherent. It starts with a polite acknowledgement, then offers three distinct, albeit somewhat loosely connected, suggestions for self-improvement. The connection is the implied theme of finding fulfillment or purpose. However, the abrupt shift from a simple \"You're welcome\" to philosophical advice lacks a smooth transition.\n\n* **Fluency:** The response is grammatically correct and uses appropriate vocabulary. The writing style is fluent and readable.\n\n* **Instruction Following:** The response goes beyond a simple \"You're welcome.\" While not explicitly instructed to offer advice, the response interprets the user's gratitude as an opening for further interaction and offers suggestions.  This is a reasonable interpretation, but it's not directly following a specific instruction.\n\n* **Groundedness:** The response is ungrounded in the provided context.  The prompt gives no information about the user's needs or situation, yet the response makes specific recommendations based on unnamed sources (Campbell, Aquinas, Ravikant).  This is a significant flaw.\n\n* **Verbosity:** The response is concise but sufficient.  It provides three distinct options without being overly wordy.\n\n\n**Step 2: Score Assignment and Rationale**\n\nConsidering the above assessment, I would assign the following scores:\n\n* **Coherence: 3** (Adequate, but the transition between the polite response and the philosophical advice is abrupt and could be improved.)\n* **Fluency: 5** (Exceptional, grammatically correct, uses appropriate vocabulary, and is easily readable.)\n* **Instruction Following: 3** (Adequate, it interprets the prompt in a way that allows for a more extensive response, but it doesn't directly follow any explicit instructions.)\n* **Groundedness: 1** (Very poor, the advice is completely unrelated to the context provided by the user's prompt.  The references to Campbell, Aquinas, and Ravikant are unexplained and inappropriate without further context.)\n* **Verbosity: 4** (Good, the length is appropriate and provides sufficient information without being overly wordy.)\n\n\n**Overall Score: 3** (Adequate).  While the fluency and verbosity are strong, the lack of grounding and the somewhat abrupt coherence significantly detract from the overall quality.  The response is well-written but inappropriate and irrelevant to the given prompt.  It demonstrates a lack of understanding of context and appropriate response generation.\nEvaluating prompt: \n    You are an expert evaluator assessing Text Quality (clarity, accuracy, engagement) based on:\n  ...\nSupervisor: **Step 1: Criterion Assessment**\n\n* **Coherence:** The response is coherent. It starts with a polite acknowledgment, then smoothly transitions into a structured three-point framework for self-reflection.  The points are logically connected, leading to a concluding recommendation for action.\n\n* **Fluency:** The response is fluent and grammatically correct. The vocabulary is sophisticated but appropriate, enhancing the overall tone.  The phrasing is smooth and easy to read.\n\n* **Instruction Following:** The response goes far beyond a simple acknowledgment of \"thanks.\" While not explicitly instructed to provide advice, it offers helpful and insightful suggestions for self-improvement, which could be considered a reasonable interpretation of a grateful user's implicit need for guidance or further interaction.\n\n* **Groundedness:** The response isn't grounded in the provided context.  The prompt is extremely minimal, offering no context for the advice given.  The response introduces unrelated philosophical figures (Campbell, Aquinas, Ravikant) without explanation or justification. This is a significant weakness.\n\n* **Verbosity:** The response is appropriately verbose. It provides sufficient detail to explain the three-point framework without being overly wordy.\n\n\n**Step 2: Score Assignment**\n\nConsidering the above assessment, I assign the following scores:\n\n* **Coherence: 5** -  The structure and flow of ideas are excellent.\n* **Fluency: 5** - Grammatically perfect and uses sophisticated language effectively.\n* **Instruction Following: 3** - While polite and helpful, it significantly expands on the prompt without explicit permission.  The implicit assumption of needing advice is a stretch.\n* **Groundedness: 1** -  The introduction of unrelated philosophical figures without context is a major flaw.  It lacks relevance to the minimal prompt.\n* **Verbosity: 4** - The length is appropriate and provides sufficient detail.\n\n\n**Overall Score: 3**\n\nThe response demonstrates strong coherence and fluency. However, its lack of grounding in the provided context significantly detracts from its quality.  While helpful, the unsolicited advice, though well-written, makes the response less relevant to the user's simple \"thanks.\"  A higher score would be warranted if the prompt had provided more context or if the response had been more explicitly tied to the user's likely needs based on the \"thanks.\"  As it stands, it's adequate but not exceptional.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20}]}
