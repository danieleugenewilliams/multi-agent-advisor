# Multi-Agent Life Advisor: Interactive Advisory Board
## Use Case
This project creates an interactive "board of advisors" with Career and Money agents, using LangGraph and tools to provide personalized, actionable advice tailored to specific user goalsâ€”or to help articulate goals when users are unsure.

## Problem
People often need tailored guidance to achieve specific career or financial goals but may struggle to define those goals clearly, limiting the effectiveness of generic advice.

## Solution
We use:
1. **Agents**: Career and Money advisors collaborate via LangGraph in an interactive chat, powered by configurable LLMs (cloud or local), to offer goal-specific advice or assist in goal-setting.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Grounds advice via a `@tool`-annotated function, inspired by *Principles* (Dalio), *The Intelligent Investor* (Graham), and the FIRE Toolbox.
3. **Structured Output**: Returns advice in JSON when finalized, with conversational flexibility.
4. **Evaluation**: Optionally collects user ratings (1-5) to assess advice quality, saved to a JSON file for potential future training.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Run the setup cell to install dependencies. Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in Kaggle Secrets for Gemini LLM.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust `CONFIG` below to toggle evaluation (`ENABLE_EVALUATION`), swap LLMs (`MODEL_CONFIG`), and customize behavior.
3. **Run**: Execute the notebook to start the chat. Type goals or questions, rate advice if enabled, and use 'q' to quit and see/download ratings.
4. **Download Ratings**: After quitting, run the download cell to access `ratings.json`.
